# Vanguard-0 Technical Specifications

## Status: Component Selection Phase

### Target Performance
- Hover time: 30+ seconds stable
- Flight time: 8-10 minutes
- Altitude hold: ±0.2m
- Total mass: 1.5-2.0 kg

### Propulsion (TBD - Researching)
- Configuration: 4× ducted fans
- Options under consideration:
  - 64mm EDF units
