# VANGUARD-0

**Tactical VTOL Demonstrator Platform**

---

## Mission Statement

Vanguard-0 is a functional VTOL drone built to:

1. Demonstrate multi-disciplinary engineering capability
2. Secure admission to Mechanical Engineering Technology program
3. Build foundational skills for future aerospace projects
4. Serve as proof-of-concept for systems integration

**Vanguard-0 is NOT the final goal. It is the foundation.**

---

## What Vanguard-0 Is

- Portfolio weapon for program admission
- Learning platform for CAD, controls, integration
- Functional flight demonstrator
- Professional documentation showcase

## What Vanguard-0 Is NOT

- GT-7 Specter (the true vision - requires aerospace education)
- Custom aerodynamic optimization (uses proven commercial components)
- Production-ready design (prototype "zero" - expect iteration)

---

## Technical Overview

**Platform Type:** Quadcopter-style VTOL with angular stealth aesthetics  
**Propulsion:** 4× commercial ducted fans (64-70mm EDF units)  
**Control:** Custom PID implementation on Arduino/Pixhawk  
**Innovation:** Integrated duct-body design (simplified curved channels)  

**Target Performance:**

- Stable hover: 30+ seconds
- Flight time: 8-10 minutes
- Altitude hold: ±0.2m accuracy
- Total mass: 1.5-2.0 kg

## Philosophy

**"Build the foundation before the fortress."**

Vanguard-0 is not a compromise. It's strategic preparation. Every skill learned here, every system integrated, every challenge overcome - all of it builds toward GT-7 Specter.

This is not settling for less. This is earning the right to build more.
